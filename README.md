### Python 3.9.7
 * Lotto Generator

   My very first project in Python. Generates desired number of 6 unique, random number sets, and saves them in "wyniki lotto.txt".

 * Guessing Game

   First assignment from the Perian Data 2022 Complete Python Bootcamp. Player has to guess the number between 1 and 100. The game tells, whether each guess is closer to the target than the previous one.

 * Guessing Game 2

   My take on the game, got rid of errors created by user putting incorrect data, added chart showing player's progress etc.
